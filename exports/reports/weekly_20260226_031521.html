  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Signals are collected from RSS feeds (news, community, advocacy), clustered using HDBSCAN (min_cluster_size=2, metric=euclidean) on sentence-transformer embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim). Cluster strength uses exponential time-decay (72h half-life). Safety buffer enforces 24h delay, 3+ signals, 2+ sources, volume >= 1.0. This report is tier 1 with 24h delay.</p>
