### Mobile CSS Enhancements

Added touch-optimized styles for new sections:

}

details summary {
    padding: 0.75rem;
    background: var(--bg-secondary);
    border-radius: 6px;
    touch-action: manipulation;

## Deployment

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Production

## Philosophy Alignment

These changes maintain HEAT's core principles:

1. **Interpretation over surveillance** — Resources empower informed decision-making
2. **Community safety first** — Emergency preparedness emphasizes legal rights
3. **Transparent limitations** — Disclaimers clearly state what HEAT does/doesn't claim
4. **Ethical responsibility** — No ownership claims; respects source material rights

## Testing

- ✅ Local preview server verified (port 8000)
- ✅ Mobile responsive design maintained
- ✅ Touch-optimized tap targets for details/summary
- ✅ Accessibility: collapsible sections with semantic HTML

## Impact

Users now have:
- **Direct access** to 5 trusted immigration rights organizations
- **Actionable knowledge** for ICE encounters (home, public, preparedness)
- **Clear understanding** of HEAT's limitations and data sources
- **Legal protection** — No false claims, respects source material rights

**Note:** This update strengthens HEAT's civic empowerment mission while maintaining responsible, delayed-aggregation architecture. Users are better informed to protect themselves and make independent decisions.
